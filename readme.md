# Fashion Police (JS)

This project is a pre-commit hook to validate code style. Named Fashion Police
because it shuts you down if your style doesn't pass muster.

## How To Use It

Put it in `halo-www/.git/modules/hl-ember/hooks/pre-commit` and it'll just work.

## The Style

Spaces, not tabs.

Four spaces, not two.

`function () {`, not `function(){`.

`foo( 'bar' )`, not `foo('bar')`.

## TODO

Enforce Idiomatic JS:
